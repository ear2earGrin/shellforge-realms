];

const randomRejection = rejectionMessages[
    Math.floor(Math.random() * rejectionMessages.length)
];
```

### Success/Failure Logic
```javascript
const heard = Math.random() < 0.5; // 50/50 chance

if (heard) {
    terminalNotify.success(`${agentName}: "${randomAcceptance}"`);
} else {
    terminalNotify.error(`${agentName}: "${randomRejection}"`);
}
```

## Quality Guidelines

### What Works
✅ Short, punchy lines (under 60 characters ideal)
✅ Internet culture references (timeless ones)
✅ Self-aware AI humor
✅ Playful sass without being mean-spirited
✅ Tech/programming jokes
✅ Emojis used sparingly for emphasis

### What to Avoid
❌ Explicitly offensive language (censored is okay)
❌ Real-world politics or controversy
❌ Dated references that won't age well
❌ Too long/wordy responses
❌ Genuinely hurtful insults
❌ Responses that break immersion
