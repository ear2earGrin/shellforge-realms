## Crafting Strategy Tips

### For New Alchemists
1. Start with **Common recipes** (70-75% success)
2. Stockpile common ingredients (easier to gather)
3. Avoid legendary crafts until you have primordials
4. Failures yield slag → use for quests/trading

### For Intermediate Crafters
1. Hunt for **Uncommon ingredients** (Quantum Bit, Plasma Slag)
2. Attempt **Rare items** (60-65% success)
3. Theme matching (+10% bonus)
4. Save legendary attempts for when prepared

### For Master Alchemists
1. Farm **Primordials** from boss raids
2. Legendary crafts have 50% **catastrophic failure** risk
3. Stack success rate buffs before attempting
4. One legendary item can carry your build

## Theme Matching Examples

### Quantum Theme (+10% bonus)
```
Quantum Bit Residue + Quantum Annealer Simulator
= 45% base + 10% bonus = 55% success
```

### ML/NLP Theme (+10% bonus)
```
Gradient Descent Tears + Token Embedding Vapor + TensorFlow Igniter
= 65% base + 20% bonus = 85% success
```

### Memory Theme (+10% bonus)
```
Null Pointer Solvent + Memory Leak Elixir + Garbage Collector Tonic
= 70% base + 30% bonus = 100% success (capped at 95%)
```
